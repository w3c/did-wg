{: .no_toc}

The group uses MIT’s WebEx Instance for the calls.

**Joining the call is restricted to the official members of the DID Working Group.** Joining the group for representatives of W3C Members can be done via the [join form](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/{{ site.groupid }}/join) (this form must be filled by the AC representative of the Member organization).

## Teleconference Logistics

* WebEx can be used by dialing in: +1-617-324-0000
* One can also use the Web address and that leads to a choice of either starting up Skype-like application or stay within the browser using WebRTC. There is also the possibility to use dedicated [WebEx clients](https://www.w3.org/2006/tools/wiki/InstallingWebEx) on, e.g., mobile phones.
* If one logs in, the application also offers a dial back to another number (internationally)

In all cases you will need a a 9 digit code and/or a dedicated Web address, and possibly a password. These have been announced on a WG-only email, see the [archived copy](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-did-wg/2020Feb/0000.html))for details. ***These data should never be sent out on a public channel, email, irc, etc.*** (the MIT WebEx instance gets regularly hacked, and Cisco can decide to deactivate the call).
